This terraform script is to create vpc with public and private subnets and create 2 ec2 instances in each subnet.

Process:
Here i want to create 2 modules for vpc and ec2 
ec2 need to create in the same vpc
for that we need vpc id, required subnet ids, for that in module/vpc/outputs.tf i defined vpc and subnet id's.
in module/ec2/variable.tf, i defined vpc, required subnets as variable and type as string with logical name.
in module/ec2/ec2.tf, wherever vpc, subnet required i define like "var.logicalnameofvpc(or)subnet".
in main.tf in the root folder, i defined vpc and ec2 modules.
in ec2 module, after source path defination, i used vpc, subnet variables logical id's to define variable values
syntax like this


<variable logial id> = module.<vpc module logical name defined in main.tf>.<logical name of vpc in the output>
