This terraform script is to import existing vpc and will be managed by terraform after terraform plan and apply

Here i have created vpc, 2 subnets, internet gateway and internet gateway associated with public subnet

i want to import these resources into terraform after that i want to manage resources by terraform

import syntax:

terraform import [options] ADDR ID

ADDR - aws_vpc.<logical name>
ID - id of existing vpc

ex: terraform import aws_vpc.main vpc-134354345

import block syntax:

import {
  to = "aws_vpc.<logical name>"
  id = "vpc-56789765e4"
}

import block syntax for module:

import {
  to = module.<module logical name>.aws_vpc.<vpc logical name>
  id = "vpc-0226f6ec693232601"
}


import {
  to = module.vpc_module.aws_subnet.private_subnet_test
  id = "subnet-0226f6ec693232601"
}
